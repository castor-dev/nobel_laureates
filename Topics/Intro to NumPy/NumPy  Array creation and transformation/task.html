<div class="step-text">
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div><p>Using the NumPy library, consider the following step sequence:</p><p>1. You want to create a 3x2 matrix from a list of lists with integer values from 1 to 6.</p><p>2. You want to convert the datatype of the matrix from integer to float.</p><p>3. You want to create a 1D array out of the matrix using the ravel function.</p><p>Which code snippets can perform these actions?</p>
